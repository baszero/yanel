Resources are
responsible for processing requests and generating responses. Examples are</p><ul><li>Node/File resource which helps to retrieve static content, for example images or PDF documents.<br/></li><li>XML resource which helps to generate XHTML or generic XML pages by applying various XSLTs to some original XML</li><li>Calendar resource which helps to read/write calendars based on the ICS format (for example with Sunbird as a client)</li></ul>

<p>The Yanel distribution (source and binary) contains many more examples, which can be reused or customized.<br/><br/>For complete customization, one can also <a href="../create-new-resource.html">create a resource from scratch</a> very easily, whereas a
resource from scratch doesn't do much in the first place. In order to actually get life into a from scratch resource one can implement various <a class="external" href="http://yanel.wyona.org/javadoc/org/wyona/yanel/core/api/attributes/package-summary.html">interfaces</a><img class="outlink" src="http://documentation.yanel.wyona.org/images/out.png" alt=""/>. In most cases one wants to implement the four basic functions called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
</p>

A resource can also be used by another resource.
For example the generic "user registration" resource can be extended by a custom user registration resource.
In order to do so one makes the generic resource available by adding a pom file to this resource (e.g. <code>YANEL_HOME/src/resources/registration/src/build/pom.xml</code>) and by adding its dependency to the custom resource which is extending the generic resource (e.g. <code>MY_REALM/resources/custom-registration/src/build/dependencies.xml</code>). Please make sure to re-build Yanel in order to update the local maven repository based on the added pom file.
