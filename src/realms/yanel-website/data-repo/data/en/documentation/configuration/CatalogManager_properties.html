    <h1>Configuration of CatalogManager.properties</h1>
<p>
XML documents typically refer to external entities, for example the public and/or system ID for the Document Type Definition. These external relationships are expressed using URIs, typically as URLs.
</p>

<p>
However, if they are absolute URLs, they only work when your network can reach them. Relying on remote resources makes XML processing susceptible to both planned and unplanned network downtime.
</p>

<p>
One way to avoid these problems is to use an entity resolver or a URI resolver. Yanel is currently using <code>org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver</code>, whereas see for example <code>src/impl/java/org/wyona/yanel/impl/resources/BasicXMLResource.java</code>.
</p>

<p>
The catalog manager/resolver configuration is located at <code>YANEL_HOME/conf/CatalogManager.properties</code> or rather <code>TOMCAT/webapps/yanel/WEB-INF/classes/CatalogManager.properties</code>.
</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <pre>
catalogs=catalog.xml

relative-catalogs=false

# verbosity: If non-zero, the Catalog classes will print informative and debugging messages (see TOMCAT/logs/catalina.out). 
# The higher the number, the more messages.
#verbosity=100
verbosity=1
    </pre>
